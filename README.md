# Just Loading

## Description

**Just Loading** is a project that provides a script for automating the loading of key customer information into a database. This tool is designed to simplify the process of collecting, processing, and storing data in business applications where reliable and efficient handling of large data volumes is required.

## Technologies

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **C++**: Implementation of the main data processing algorithms.
- **Oracle**: Used as the primary database for storing customer data.
- **JavaScript**: Script for interacting with the database and managing the loading process.
- **MySQL**: An alternative database for data storage.

## Features

- Connects to Oracle/MySQL databases.
- Loads and validates customer data from various sources.
- Processes data using algorithms written in C++.
- Interacts with the database through JavaScript.
- Flexible configuration of loading parameters via a configuration file.

## Installation and Running

### Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or MSVC) installed.
- Oracle or MySQL database installed.
- Node.js for running JavaScript files.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OleksandrOstroukhov/Just-Loading.git
   cd Just-Loading
   ```

2. **Configure the database settings:**

   - Open the `config.json` file and enter your database connection parameters.

3. **Compile and run the C++ code:**

   - To compile the C++ program:
   
     ```bash
     g++ main.cpp -o loadData
     ```

   - To run the program:

     ```bash
     ./loadData
     ```

4. **Run the JavaScript script:**

   - Ensure Node.js is installed.
   - Run the script to interact with the database:

     ```bash
     node database.js
     ```

## Future Improvements

- Adding support for PostgreSQL and other databases.
- Expanding the JavaScript user interface for more flexible management of the loading process.
- Optimizing performance for data processing.
